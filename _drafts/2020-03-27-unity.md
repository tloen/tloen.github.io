In the past decade, we have grown accustomed to understanding extreme polarization to be one of the defining features of American politics. For those of us doing the polarizing, this critique is taken in stride. They do not recognize themselves in the currently existing regime, nor in the world order that holds it in place. Thus, they see no reason to be beholden to the state that they live in, or to see the world in terms of these national boundaries.

This is a problem that cannot be solved, as some chronic commentators seem to think, by the reawakening of some abstract patriotism that will bring the country together. Nor will our weariness of conflict do the trick. Patriotism can't exist without an identification of self with country, and the only ones among us growing tired of conflict are those growing old. All the while, the core issue remains unresolved: that despite its best efforts, any organization of the size of the American state cannot but take on the properties of a Gnostic demiurge.
