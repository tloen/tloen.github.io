When

Looking back, I've realized that most of the posts on this blog have been guided by a central theme â€” that of _cognitive effort_. Throughout my posts on sensory overload, on entropy, and on determination, I've been trying to to reach a detailed and practical understanding of cognitive effort. In my view it is far from sufficient to understand cognitive effort as an abstract limited resource. Several questions remain. What is the nature of this resource? By what is it limited? How negotiable is this limiting factor? These questions cannot be answered without providing an account of what cognitive effort actually is.

There are several tasks that I have always thought of as requiring cognitive effort:

- Learning a densely interdependent set of topics with many layers of abstraction.
- Reasoning from first principles without relying on the thoughts or opinions of others.
- Making a choice between a number of alternatives.

I have always felt that these tasks are quite similar.

Each carries an element of surprise.

This theme runs through my posts on sensory overload, on entropy, and on determination. Each of these posts deals with cognitive effort.
