Just as it is typical in the first issue of a new publication to find a manifesto full of heady promise and affected daring, in the first post of a personal blog one frequently discovers a timid apology from the author for subjecting the reader to his drivel.

Most such apologies are warranted. One generally writes in public to prove a point not about the world, but about oneself â€” inescapably a tedious subject for any reader. Johnson observed that "no man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money." Plying my trade elsewhere than the written word, and being a bit of a blockhead myself, I have often quipped that if I am ever caught writing in public it can only have been to impress a woman.
