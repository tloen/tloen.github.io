### The education of an industry

//elaborate on origins of the californian ideology
//why libertarianism?
I am not a libertarian, and have never described myself as such. Libertarianism as a movement had already made its retreat

Tyler Cowen, Silicon Valley's intellectual conscience _de facto_, [noted](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html) at the turn of the decade that the libertarian movement as it had previously existed was effectively defunct. Though it still has its established adherents both at the fringe and at the center, the intellectual dynamism of the movement has largely moved on to _state capacity libertarianism_, which Prof. Cowen defines as a synthesis of libertarianism with the recognition that a strong state is necessary.

It may seem ironic that the first 21st-century political movement that directly supports the expansion of state sovereignty should emerge dialectically from libertarianism. But it is completely natural that this view should emerge from Silicon Valley, whose founding assumption that things should work, and should work easily. For years, tech workers have militated against rent-seeking and institutional sclerosis in all its forms, bemoaning zoning laws, occupational licensing, and the California DMV.

But however enlightening the libertarian perspective on existing affairs may be, several factors make it unviable as a political ideology. One may refer to these factors in the abstract as libertarianism's _incompatibility with democracy_, its actively opposition to the ability of peoples and nations to make laws for themselves.

In the concrete, an average libertarian may blame zoning laws and local authorities for the various inefficiencies that occur in the markets for housing and human capital. An honest libertarian will admit that it is not in the particular interest of anyone in the city or state _ex ante_ to correct these inefficiencies, but will assert that it is morally incumbent upon them to vote against their particular interests for the sake of the universal. A perceptive libertarian will understand that this will never happen. An effort of this sort, if it should and will occur, must originate in the state. And since we are speaking in the concrete, it would be relatively uncontroversial to say that this is similarly unlikely in today's political environment.

### Deuniversalization

Given that the responsibility of overcoming particularism falls on the state, there are a variety of partisan narratives of why it fails to fulfil this function virtually always. It may be, as the left holds it, that the state is excessively beholden to capital. It may also be, as the right holds it, that it is excessively beholden to the cultural elite. Certainly, for the last three decades, the state has served these interests well. But it has done so only by the consistent, unwavering policy of taking no decisive action whatsoever. The supposed competence with which the state promotes these "special interests" is the competence of incompetence — a political vacuum in which the existing state of affairs continues its slow, cancerous entrenchment.

The central problem is that our systems of governance are incapable of producing any sort of coordination. Fukuyama's term for this is _vetocracy_, a state of political decay in which the _no_ of the particular becomes much louder than the _yes_ of the universal. Such a system precludes any premeditated change facilitated by the state. But it does not abolish change altogether.

Instead, it leaves change to be determined by market forces, technological progress, natural disasters, hostile powers — anything but the population itself. The state is the only effective vehicle by which the political community at large can shape its own destiny. When it abandons this responsibility, it disenfranchises the vast majority of the people it represents.

It is commonly held that the populist uprisings of the past decade have been reactions to the imposition of the universal on the particular. In this view, any successful populist uprising creates a government whose anti-universalism dooms it to instability and a swift return to the dustbin of history. One must therefore oppose populism before it does too much damage to our institutions.

But this story leaves much to be desired. It fails to account for left populism of the Bernie Sanders variety, which if anything demands a _greater_ imposition of the universal on the particular. A sizable portion of voters voted for Ron Paul, then Bernie Sanders, then Andrew Yang. These candidates were not all staunch particularists. Their voters did not want to destroy the universal. What they wanted was a _credible_ universal, something outside themselves that they could identify with and that would act credibly on their behalf.

Vetocracy is the reason existing governments cannot provide this universal. A state incapable of action cannot claim to embody any universal ideals whatsoever. But the cause of vetocracy is

What, then, are its causes?

The populist uprisings of the past decade owe a great deal to the resentment of a state that grants no recognition to the will of its community, that

What is the cause of vetocracy?

More broadly speaking, vetocracy is a state where the particular tramples all over the universal.

- But state coordination is how the popular will manifests itself. The state makes the nation as much as the nation makes the state.

- The growing realization that the state is a dead player

, in any case, is what Fukuyama terms _vetocracy_ — a system excessively beholden in general, in which _no_ counts for far more than _yes_. Such a system cannot take any effective action, and collapses into a state of inaction.

The left would argue that the state is beholden to the

Why libertarianism?

The condition reflected in the state's inability to overcome particularism

But we get ahead of ourselves. Why talk about conventional libertarianism when it is unpopular, and always doomed to be unpopular?

Conventional libertarianism concerns itself primarily with negative freedoms that most will never have the desire or the opportunity to exercise, and it demands them at the cost of positive political freedoms that we are quite used to exercising. Its natural ideological base, which it yet retains, is an uneasy alliance between those who want to exercise the absent negative freedoms and those alienated from their present positive freedoms. Democracy's task is to minimize the size of this alliance, and for all its failings, it has succeeded at least in this.

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, architect of the Pearl Harbor attack and commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1939 until his death in 1943, never said this:

> _I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve._

Nor, as a matter of fact, did he say this:

> _You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass._

Yet both misquotes resurface constantly — in action movies, in video games, in pro-gun memes posted to Facebook walls. It is not that we don't know any better — we do. But we need Yamamoto to have said these things, because we need to believe them and yet we cannot in good faith say them ourselves.

If our nation possesses great strength, it certainly have not used it. If the crisis of the last few years is a temporary setback, it has grown more permanent by the day. Society is in chaos, the state in absentia; stagnation is on our lips, decline on our minds. America must believe it is a sleeping giant, because the only alternative is that the giant is dead.

Now the coronavirus has called our bluff. The invasion has come, and Americans face an existential threat to their way of life. Still, the giant sleeps.

### II. The giant sleeps

We love misquoting Yamamoto, not because we don't know any better but because we love to imagine ourselves a force to be reckoned with. And we will go to [absurd lengths](https://napavalleyregister.com/news/opinion/mailbag/standing-by-disputed-quote-on-guns/article_0ebd672c-739c-562c-bb3f-8bb4e7ac9218.html) to preserve this myth.

In this latter narrative, which has been flitting around the edges of respectable opinion until relatively recently, we have been living for the last few decades in the giant's hollowed-out corpse. For a large part, the state has abandoned a substantial amount of its serious decision-making power to the sphere of commerce, becoming a largely administrative operation and leaving the political freedom of the voter more or less meaningless. Some proponents of this narrative describe the U.S. as a "free-trade zone", or a "bureaucratic anarchy with a ceremonial elected monarchs." But by and large, public opinion has been dominated by sleeping-giant believers.

The recent months have called their bluff. Now Pearl Harbor is a secondary consideration; of primary importance is the coronavirus outbreak, which has left the United States, with its seven hundred thousand cases as of this writing, in a deeply embarrassing condition. In the pandemic we see a crisis equal in scope to a Japanese bombing, precipitated by an invisible enemy towards whom we need not show sympathy. Yet, in the face of what may be the most favorable conditions for a war, with all the "terrible resolve" we can muster, we have yet to awaken the giant. The extent of the exercise of the American national will has been limited to a financial intervention by Congress on behalf of the sphere of commerce to which it has delegated most of its options.

I don't want to dwell on the specific failures of the government. This is not a post about coronavirus. But I would like to examine how the giant died, and how it might return to life.

## I. War and the State

The American contract is as follows:

But just as it is misleading to assume that societies are formed in contracts, it is misleading to assume that

Most of us understand the state insofar as it affects us.

The state is a machine for the exercise of the political will.

## The Use of War

around the 2016 election, which brought to power a candidate that promised to "make America great again" and whose shadowy advisor aimed to "deconstruct the administrative state."

In response to the election, a number of us doubled down on our obsession with the sleeping giant. If anything, Trump's victory provided a perfect frame for the narrative and enabled a full-throated, absolutely sincere defense of the _status quo_. Our experts, norms, and institutions were what formerly made us great; our slumber now is a dogmatic slumber, a miasma of confused and unenlightened resentments, soon to be broken on the wheel of history.
