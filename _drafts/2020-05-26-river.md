I stepped into the river,
Water warping, gleaming, cold.
Feet wet, skin warm and dry,
Down bore the sun, and the yellow trees.

Among the pebbles I stood,
Wet marbles unaccounted
In the system of the universe.
The river, too, was never dreamt,
Coming to be itself only in time
And undoing itself the same way.
Gleaming and cold was the river,
And its waters warped.

Down bore the light of the afternoon
Upon the earth
(But stopping short),
And it struck something
Interposed between the sun and the water.
