A compelling case can be made that Polydamas' reliance on omens is more rational than the deliberative strategy we have now. The argument is not my own; I heard it first about a year ago, in an East London gastropub, from Dominic Cummings — or was it Marc Warner? — who had surely read it somewhere else. Reconstructed, it goes something like this:

- John von Neumann showed in 1928 that all two-person zero-sum games with perfect information have a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. (This is the _minimax theorem._)
- It is impossible to implement a mixed strategy without the ability to sample from a categorical distribution — that is, a source of entropy.
- Decision-making can rely only on credible sources.
- There are no credible sources of entropy in the Pentagon.
- There is a credible source of entropy in the Iliad (the imputed will of the gods).
- Therefore, Hector and Polydamas can implement a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, while Bush and Powell cannot.

The Pentagon is a democratically accountable institution. By and large, it can be expected to act in ways that are at least ostensibly explainable. When a course of action seems best to achieve its ends, it cannot but take that course. In no case can it entrust decisions to coin flips or divination. But this is exactly what puts it at a disadvantage against an adversary like Troy.

Theoretically, Troy may be able to predict Arlington's behavior. Suppose it really could. What would this mean?

It is generally considered somewhat demeaning to predict someone's behavior. We would like to believe that we are the causes of things; that when we do good and evil, we are to be praised and blamed. Predicting someone's behavior does two things to their dignity: first, it removes their sense of agency by moving their locus of control from the will to the dispositions; second, it tells them that _I am better than you_.

Intellectual equals may simulate one another's trains of thought and follow them step by step. If I can run around your trains of thought and anticipate their conclusions, I must be either faster or cleverer than you. One is reminded of the halting problem: if a program can reason efficiently about the behavior of a certain class of machines, it must be running on a machine more powerful than that entire class. 

One man's randomness is another man's will. One man's will is another man's computation. But in each case we would always like to be the other man. We would like our will to be so profound it seems random to the untrained eye, our computation so powerful that it encompasses all the striving and the vicissitudes of the other's will.

When your relative entropy is low enough that people can predict your behavior with reasonable accuracy, you are not in a good place.

To predict someone's train of thought is to be able to simulate it.

To predict someone's actions ahead of time is to be either faster or cleverer than are.

It is hampered by the expectation of absolute computation.

We've seen that decisions are made through a combination of randomness, computation, and will. We know that will is something between randomness and computation; we've taken a few stabs at getting to the heart of this distinction, but haven't really reached a satisfactory answer.

That A can predic

We would like to believe that we are not predictable.

To suggest to someone that his behavior is predictable is an insult. It means that he is nothing more than a set of simple dispositions in a body, and that you are so much smarter than him that

It is essential to

Randomness is a scarce resource to begin with. Attempt to generate it and one is confronted with the fact that the mind, generally speaking, is a deterministic function. Most "random" strings alternate between the left- and right- hand sides of a keyboard. Most "randomly chosen" numbers are usually 17 or 37. There is entropy in the distribution, but it is not nearly as much as one might hope.

And al this aside

We've seen that all decisions are made through a combination of randomness, computation, and will. When we introduced this tripartite breakdown, we attempted a complexity-theoretic definition of the components. That definition may well be correct, but it doesn't tell us much about the properties of each. So let's attempt another one:

- _Computation_ is any process in which decisions are made by our universal properties as abstract rational agents.
- _Will_ is any process in which decisions are made by our particular properties as specific human beings.
- _Randomness_ is any process in which decisions are made by forces outside our control.

This seems to be an exhaustive classification _prima facie_. Moreover,

But we do not

But outside of carefully constructed theoretical situations, computation is simply intractible. The search space is far too large.

In practice, elements of randomness and will pervade everything.

What, then, is the difference between randomness and will?

In this piece we have covered a lot of ground. We began — again — by examining choice in the abstract with an eye toward the problem of starting a company. With the tools of information theory, we formalized this task in the equation _D = R + C + W_. Using this equation, we arrived at the fundamental dilemma of _Zero to One_—that none of the components seemed powerful enough to complete the circuit and discharge its potential.

So we stepped back from this problem in the individual case and looked at how this problem has been surmounted historically. We examined the determinative assembly-line of the modern corporation and the slow havoc it has wreaked on our capacity for independent action. We saw a world beset by decadence, where ideas and solutions are few and far between. And we have arrived at the conclusion that war is the mechanism by which this decadence had historically been purged. What on earth are we to do now?

It would be unconscionable to start a war today for the pure sake of determination. But we may aim to replicate the effect of war on an individual scale. War causes the individual to understand himself not as an individual in the abstract but as an element of a nation. It causes him to rally around his sovereign, but this sovereign represents something about the individual of which he may only have been dimly aware. Confronted with a foreign will that would destroy it, the individual comes to determine itself through this confrontation, overcoming his initial undetermination.

We may call Sartre's existentialism the ultimate expression of undetermination — or "radical freedom," as he would call it. Against Sartre we must array all the things that bind and differentiate us: our origins, our beliefs, our culture, our quirks, our strengths and weaknesses — in short, our narrative. In understanding ourselves we must discard our abstract understanding of ourselves as "individuals" and affirm everything that makes us different — everything for which we might go to war.

Lightning will strike when you can marshal the preexisting facts of your life — the dicethrow — into a unified narrative that constrains the space of possibility. It will strike when you understand yourself as distinct from others, to the point where you know which options you can realistically take, and hence which other options you can discard. When you affirm the randomness that has created you and reject the randomness of the lottery, you transmute randomness into will, and you arrive invariably at determination.
