_This piece offers another perspective on the overdetermined effect elaborated [here](../sensory-overload)._

Readers of this blog are probably familiar with Csikszentmihalyi's concept of _flow_, a mental state characterized by extreme focus and productivity, which also goes by the name of the 道.

1. The terror of flow; the delight of transcendence and being.
2. Paranoia: Descartes, LessWrong, "first principles" thinking.
3. The emptiness of the subject: Girard, Hegel.
4. Hardness vs. Randomness; form and content
5. Becoming who you are or the retreat into optionality
