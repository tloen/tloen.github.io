We have considered the entrepreneur in terms of the process that produced him, and we have concluded that his immediate problem is a scarcity of determination. We have articulated a theory of what determination is: it is the vector spanning abstract and concrete; it is a concept that subsumes randomness, computation, and will; and it is a sort of information.

All the while, our discussion has drawn deeper and deeper into the theoretical. But our goal has always been practical; we have stripped away the veneer of false abstraction around the entrepreneur to get to his true essence, and the fundamental nature of the problem he faces. And now that we have grasped the core of the problem, we may begin to solve it.

### i. Microdetermination

![](/assets/images/scutum2.jpg)

> _In accordance with what has been already shown... it is necessary to say that the intellect is a power of the soul, and not the very essence of the soul. For then alone the essence of that which operates is the immediate principle of operation, when operation itself is its being: for as power is to operation as its act, so is the essence to being. But in God alone His action of understanding is His very Being. Wherefore in God alone is His intellect His essence: while in other intellectual creatures, the intellect is power.[^summa]_

[^summa]: Aquinas, _Summa Theologica_, q. 79, a. 1

We may more closely examine the sources of determination and their interaction through an example from experience. Stanford University offers forty-six majors. I majored in math. Why and how did I do this? _Randomness, computation, and will_.

- (_Randomness_) Owing to my circumstances, most majors at Stanford were ones that I never seriously considered. Either they had never come to my attention or I had never been bothered to think of them as options. I have never seriously considered majoring in chemical engineering, for instance, although I see no strong reason why I shouldn't have.
- (_Computation_) Of the majors I did consider, I could rationally rule out a number of them in universal terms because they seemed worse than the others. Economics and philosophy fell by the wayside here. I was quite interested in both topics. But they were comparatively easy to learn independently, and hence not a particularly wise use of the credentialing mechanism of the university. Because I bear the misfortune of having to work to live, I decided that my life would be best if I majored in math, statistics, or computer science.
- (_Will_) Between these majors there was no clear choice. They led down different routes, but none seemed unequivocally, universally best. Thus I chose the route I felt was right and majored in math.

This process played out over the course of two and a half years. Out of forty-six majors, I only really considered maybe eight; of these eight, I ruled out all but three; of these three, I chose one. We can say something like this:

> _lg(46/8) = 2.52_ bits of randomness (_R_)  
> \+ _lg(8/3) = 1.42_ bits of computation (_C_)  
> \+ _lg(3/1) = 1.58_ bits of will (_W_)  
> \= _lg(46/1) = 5.52_ bits of determination required for action (_D_).

That is,

> **_R + C + W = D._**

The specific quantities are not important[^null]. Having actually majored in math, I already feel mildly ill for having computed and typed out some actual, specific numbers. Let's just move on — what is important is that we can provide an exhaustive account of determination on terms of these three components, and that this account is itself a useful accounting identity.

[^null]: In any case, their calculation depends on the null distribution, which we've held here to be uniform. Computing the "real" null distribution, insofar as such a distribution might exist, is difficult in some cases and virtually impossible in others.
[^rcw]: There is good reason to believe that this division of determination into randomness, computation, and will is non-overlapping and exhaustive. Randomness is a form of hardness. Hierarchies of randomness exist, corresponding to hierarchies of computational power. Insofar as a subject falls on this hierarchy, "randomness" is generated by processes of a higher class, "computation" is generated by processes of a lower class, and "will" is generated by processes in the same class. ![](/assets/images/PH.png) Randomness is what we cannot understand, computation is what we do understand, will is what we can understand with difficulty. (It is difficult to nail this concept down precisely. For more on this see [my original essay on the subject](/2020/03/31/entropy.html).)

### ii. Heaven and earth

![](/assets/images/lightning.jpg)

> _Nietzsche presents the dicethrow as taking place on two distinct tables, the earth and the sky. The earth where the dice are thrown and the sky where the dice fall back... But these tables are not two worlds. They are the two hours of a single world, the two moments of a single world, midnight and midday, the hour when the dice are thrown, the hour when the dice fall back. Nietzsche insists on the two tables of life which are also the two moments of the player or the artist; "We temporarily abandon life, in order to then temporarily fix our gaze upon it." **The dicethrow affirms being and it affirms the being of becoming.**_[^deleuze]

> _I love all those who are like heavy drops falling singly from the dark cloud that hangs over mankind: they prophesy the coming of the lightning and as prophets they perish._[^nietzsche]

[^deleuze]: Deleuze, _Nietzsche and Philosophy_, p. 25, trans. Tomlinson
[^nietzsche]: Nietzsche, _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_, Prologue 4, trans. Parkes

To begin any serious undertaking, we must produce enough determination to travel the distance _D_ from abstract contemplation to concrete action. This distance can be quantified in bits; it is the entropy of the human action space, and it is much, much greater than _lg(46)_.

In such cases we must abandon the metaphor of the "bridge between contemplation and action". Imagine instead the phenomenon of the lightning strike, which spans heaven and earth (or, to be precise, the tropospheric and the ground). When a negatively charged thundercloud appears overhead, it pulls positive ions onto the surface, inducing an enormous amount of electrostatic potential. This potential demands to be discharged, but it is blocked by an equally enormous physical distance. Only with the singular event of a lightning strike is this distance crossed and the potential discharged.

Pages more can be written about the formation of thundercloud plasma channels and their practical implications. For now it is sufficient to note that our lightning strike can cross the troposphere and manifest as action only when we provide it with enough bits. These bits must be produced by means of randomness, computation, and will. Each individual is capable of only a limited amount of computation, and a very limited amount of will.

Therefore, in any serious undertaking, we seem to have two options: to stretch our capacities of computation and will to their limits, or to let randomness do the work and make lottery tickets of ourselves.

Neither of these options seems particularly satisfactory. Public confidence in the will and the intellect are at a 500-year low, and sensible people never play the lottery. It is not sensible to believe that you are a lightning strike. It is not sensible that you are either so much luckier or cleverer than the herd as to stretch yourself across the expanse between heaven and earth. Sensible people fall more like raindrops.

This is impasse at which many of us have arrived. Perhaps growth is over. Perhaps the task at hand is impossible. [Perhaps you should not become an entrepreneur.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g4g95/peter_thiel_technology_entrepreneur_and_investor/ckfkn51/?context=3)

### iii. Macrodetermination

![](/assets/images/org-lightning.png)

> _And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening._
>
> _And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?_
>
> _And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:_
>
> _When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws._
>
> _And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good._
>
> _Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone._[^exodus]

[^exodus]: Exodus 18:13-18 (KJV)

Let's back up. If starting a large business is such a difficult endeavor that it requires one to buy a lottery ticket, develop severe autism, or become the Overman, one should wonder why any such businesses can exist at all. The answer is that the entrepreneur aims to do with one mind what large corporations do with many. We are not faced with these three dreary options if we make the difficult realization that [society exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkUwuYxVmJY).

Most businesses are organized as corporations. The heart of every corporation is the same: the abstract profit motive. But each corporation also acts concretely in the world. A large corporation is thus an example of a successful lightning strike. How is it that it can generate this amount of determination with regularity?

The answer may be found in the organization chart, which already bears a suspicious resemblance to an arc of lightning. When we trace a path from the top of an org chart to the bottom, we trace a path of successive determinations between the abstract profit motive, which sits above the board of directors, and the corporation's concrete actions, which sit below the lower-level employees.

We remarked earlier that because determination is information, we could reason about it additively. Here is a corollary: when someone at the bottom of the org chart makes an action, the determination that connects that profit motive to that action can be decomposed into the individual contributions of each organizational layer between them. Each link on the chain of command takes a partially realized product and realizes it some more. Each employee's responsibility is to take the stream of bits from above, add some of their own, and pass it down. Between heaven and earth the corporation thus interposes a series of small, incremental steps.

The joint-stock company, like the Chinese and Prussian state bureaucracies before it, is a sort of "assembly line" for determination. Its emergence allowed for the mass production of high-determination endeavors in a way that feudal or patriarchal divisions of labor could not. It laid the conceptual foundations for Fordism proper. This conceptual assembly line enabled the rapid productivity gains of the succeeding centuries. Advanced industrial society _requires_ the existence of the corporation _qua_ bureaucracy. Its continued functioning requires that most of its bitrate is channeled into the transformation of one given into another.

Thus much of the history of the last two centuries has been the slow adjustment of the superstructure to the base. In this case, the base is not the industrial technology of the productive forces but the determinative machinery of bureaucracy. When, in the 1990s and 2000s, experts agreed that globalization and technological acceleration were to become the order of the day, Americans were urged to stop resting on their laurels and to embrace industrial reorganization as the order of the day. Great emphasis was placed on being able to adapt quickly, to acquire new skills as soon as they became relevant. The professional-managerial class was urged to embrace what had long become the core of its role: not a specific task, but the transformation and augmentation of information in the abstract.

Hence it became undetermined.

### iv. Somebody else's problem

![](/assets/images/rig.jpg)

> _Что делать?_

Marc Andreessen has an essay up with the rather aggressive title ["IT'S TIME TO BUILD."](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) The essay is a reasonably well-executed jeremiad about the stagnation of Western institutions across the board. None of the points in it are especially new. But as a panoptic account of the various institutional failures brought to light by the coronavirus, it is exceedingly timely.

As a venture capitalist, Andreessen has a front-row seat to the creeping mold in even America's most productive sector. And through his experience he has grasped America's problem: that it is sclerotic, complacent. It does not _do_ enough, does not _create_ enough. We are all stuck in comfortable megacorporations and government bureaucracies, producing two or three bits a day.

We have heard similar critiques along the same lines from Tyler Cowen, Ross Douthat, and Peter Thiel. Insofar as the tech industry has a distinct intellectual center, it consists of a ragtag alliance of techno-utopian national conservatives who have believed for a relatively long time now that stagnation and rot are the order of the day. But the rank and file, the Google APMs and the Tsinghua grads, have never been particularly close to this center. Perhaps it takes a global crisis and a rousing call to action from a central, (relatively) acceptable figure like Marc Andreessen to do the trick.

But probably not.

![](/assets/images/buildingfuture.jpg){: height="360px"}

Because it was circulated primarily on Twitter, most people's impression of Andreessen's piece was conditioned to an equal extent by its metadata preview image (shown above) as by its actual content. This hideous picture is demoralizing at best and horrific at worst. It is enough to pull back the veil over an ostensibly inspirational vision and reveal the ultimately disappointing nature of its critique.

We already know we are fucked. We all know that something must be done. But we have no clue what. This has been the case for longer than any of us could have expected. The past decade (to say nothing of those preceding) is full of situations where everyone has been aware that something must be done, but nobody has taken action. In some cases — "ethics in tech" comes to mind — many people have made an entire living talking about the importance of solutions without ever attempting to produce one.

It is not an inclination to grift that produces such people. It is the simple fact that our society's [broken kingmaking mechanism](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/peter-turchin-how-elite-overproduction-and-lawyer-glut-could-ruin-the-u-s) produces elites quickly, while its low-entropy production mechanism produces original thoughts slowly. Everyone is starved for ideas. In Silicon Valley, they are positively desperate. Proclaim with a straight face in a Menlo Park café that "great ideas are a dime a dozen" and see how many dirty looks you get from the clientele.

We want to build. We want to become a nation of builders. The air is charged, the thunderbolt ready. But what path shall it take? What are we to build, exactly? That horrific abomination of a city?

Andreessen presents his essay as a positive vision. It is framed as an exhortation to the left and right to embrace a new political agenda of action. He issues a challenge to the right —

> It’s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.

— and to the left.

> Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective — how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can’t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn’t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building — energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let’s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?

Insofar as his ideas hold more content than "doing more things," he is more than accomodating of disagreement, provided that the disagreement comes with things to build:

> I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here’s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you.

This gives the lie to the essay's conceit. It reveals that its core is its negative critique and that its positive content is negotiable (hence undetermined). Now, I still love reading this sort of essay. This one in particular was quite well executed; I can see how this might be the one that finally shakes Silicon Valley out of its ideological slumber. But I have seen too many similar calls for action to seriously expect anything more to come of it.

What would work, however, is a war.

### v. War and the Determinative State

![](/assets/images/jena.jpg)

> _The essence of the modern state is the union of the universal with the full freedom of the particular, and with the welfare of individuals._[^hegel]

> _Sovereign is he who decides on the exception._[^schmitt]

[^hegel]: Hegel, _Elements of the Philosophy of Right_, § 260, trans. Dyde
[^schmitt]: Schmitt, _Political Theology_, trans. Schwab

War reorganizes the determinative capacities of the _Rechtsstaat_. In peacetime, the bulk of our capacity for determination is captured by the corporations we work for. The state, through which we are allegedly able to control our own destiny, asks of us only for a single bit (Republican or Democrat?) every two years. But in a war, particularly a war in which the economy is mobilized, the determinative capacities of corporations are subordinated to the interests of the state, and by proxy the interests of the political community.

In wartime and immediately after, a constitutional authority is capable of exerting its sovereignty in ways that it cannot in peacetime. In particular, it is capable of directing civilian effort towards activities that are not obviously profitable. In doing so, the state accomplishes two things: first, it provides the majority of the determination required to specify an endeavor; second, it completely absorbs the risk of failure in this endeavor. For a scientist or a technologist, attaching oneself to the "market inefficiency" of the wartime sovereign can be a very profitable endeavor.

The most obvious example of this is the Manhattan Project. The project which was initially instigated by a 1939 letter to FDR from Leo Szilard, who clearly perceived the scientific opportunity inherent in the war. Once the project was underway, the director of the project undertook several spending decisions that the public would have seen as excessive even in wartime. First, the government bet that a sustained fission chain reaction was possible. Based on this bet, it funded the design of two different types of bombs, U-235 and plutonium, as well as a number of reactor sites meant to test and implment each of the most promising candidate methods for manufacturing either U-235 or plutonium. The enormous amount of scientific uncertainty, which typically had to be overcome by gradual experimentation, was simply bulldozed by the sovereign will, which spent billions to remove as much of this uncertainty as possible.

World War II made America a technological superpower. It made nuclear technology. It made Silicon Valley. It made enough new materials and technologies to bring us out of a depression and into the peacetime prosperity of the three following decades. It accomplished this by supplying determination — by using government intervention to concentrate the national will within a narrow search space within which action and even exhaustive searching was possible. War makes a lightning rod of the sovereign; it makes every "somebody else's problem" the sovereign's problem. Hegel writes[^hegel2]:

> War is the state of affairs which deals in earnest with the vanity of temporal goods and concerns — a vanity at other times a common theme of edifying sermonising. **This is what makes it the moment in which the ideality of the particular attains its right and is actualised.** War has the higher significance that by its agency, as I have remarked elsewhere, 'the ethical health of peoples is preserved in their indifference to the stabilisation of finite institutions; just as the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which would be the result of a prolonged calm, so also corruption in nations would be the product of prolonged, let alone 'perpetual', peace.' **This, however, is said to be only a philosophic idea, or, to use another common expression, a 'justification of Providence', and it is maintained that actual wars require some other justification.**
>
> [...]
>
> In peace civil life continually expands; all its departments wall themselves in, and in the long run men stagnate. Their idiosyncrasies become continually more fixed and ossified. But for health the unity of the body is required, and if its parts harden themselves into exclusiveness, that is death.

[^hegel2]: _Ibid._ § 324

In peace we grow undetermined; we wallow in our freedom, never actualizing it outside ourselves. Our friend pmarca certainly knows this. May people — more than would admit — have been awaiting a great crisis, "praying to Yellowstone's magma chamber," so to speak, in the hope of beating sluggish flesh to life. Pmarca's gamble is that the coronavirus pandemic is that crisis.

That may be the case; it's too soon to tell. But there is reason to believe that it won't be the case. War, as Hegel observes, has a third function that the pandemic does not: it reminds us who we are.

### vi. The Dicethrow

![](/assets/images/fates.jpg)

> What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world — and defines himself afterwards.[^sartre]

> I liken common languid Times, with their unbelief, distress, perplexity, with their languid doubting characters and embarrassed circumstances, impotently crumbling down into ever worse distress towards final ruin;—all this I liken to dry dead fuel, waiting for the lightning out of Heaven that shall kindle it. The great man, with his free force direct out of God's own hand, is the lightning. His word is the wise healing word which all can believe in. All blazes round him now, when he has once struck on it, into fire like his own.[^carlyle]

[^sartre]: Sartre, _Existentialism is a Humanism_, trans. Mairet
[^carlyle]: Carlyle, _On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History_ (The Hero as Divinity)

In this piece we have covered a lot of ground. We began — again — by examining choice in the abstract with an eye toward the problem of starting a company. With the tools of information theory, we formalized this task in the equation _D = R + C + W_. Using this equation, we arrived at the fundamental dilemma of _Zero to One_—that none of the components seemed powerful enough to complete the circuit and discharge its potential.

So we stepped back from this problem in the individual case and looked at how this problem has been surmounted historically. We examined the determinative assembly-line of the modern corporation and the slow havoc it has wreaked on our capacity for independent action. We saw a world beset by decadence, where ideas and solutions are few and far between. And we have arrived at the conclusion that war is the mechanism by which this decadence had historically been purged. What on earth are we to do now?

Of course it would be unconscionable to start a war today for the pure sake of dynamism. But we may aim to replicate the effect of war on an individual scale. War causes societies to rally around the sovereign. But it also causes the individual to understand himself not as an individual in the abstract but as an element of a nation. Confronted with a will that would destroy it, the individual comes to determine itself through this confrontation, overcoming his initial undetermination.

We may call Sartre's existentialism the ultimate expression of undetermination — or "radical freedom," as he would call it. Against Sartre we must array all the things that bind and differentiate us: our origins, our beliefs, our culture, our quirks, our strengths and weaknesses — in short, our narrative. In understanding ourselves we must discard our abstract understanding of ourselves as "individuals" and affirm everything that makes us different — everything for which we might go to war.

Lightning will strike when you can marshal the preexisting facts of your life — the dicethrow — into a unified narrative that constrains the space of possibility. It will strike when you know yourself to the point where you know which options you can realistically take, and hence which other options you can discard. When you can affirm the randomness that has created you and reject the randomness of the lottery, randomness becomes will — and will becomes determination.
