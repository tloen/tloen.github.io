# Preface: On Means and Ends

This is an odd document.

For one, it is undeniably a product of Silicon Valley. The world of Silicon Valley is the world it inhabits, the problems of Silicon Valley are the problems with which it concerns itself, and the solutions it proposes may well be Silicon Valley solutions.

But at the same time, it is an attempt to reach something universal. Although practical considerations regarding startups are in a certain sense the motivating concern of the following pages, I will speak relatively little of them directly. What interests me in this context is not entrepreneurship _per se_, but that complex of contemplation and action that is embodied in certain nobler forms of entrepreneurship. Much of what I will have to say is theoretical, and I will draw on whatever theoretical tools I see fit for the task.

Still, the motives I have for writing this essay are, I will admit, primarily practical, and it is to questions not of principle but of principled action that I will repeatedly return. I still believe that action of this sort, insofar as it is possible, is most possible in Silicon Valley, although this may easily be an artifact of my own limited perspective. Perhaps it will find its greatest application somewhere else entirely — in Hollywood, for instance, or maybe DC.

Finally, I must acknowledge that in today's political climate it is somewhat tasteless to produce a document whose aim, if not its method, is purely practical. In the pursuit of any concrete end there arises the question of why that end is to be pursued, and whether it would be a good or bad thing should it be achieved by those pursuing it. But as Aristotle wrote, "Virtue makes the goal right, practical wisdom the things leading to it." I can hardly claim to be able to teach virtue, least of all by means of an essay like this one. So let this be a work of practical wisdom. With respect to the ultimate justification for my intermediate ends, I will pass over the matter in silence.

And as for he who has ears — let him hear.

# Introduction: Between Zero and One

> Perhaps you should not become an entrepreneur...
>
> — Peter Thiel

In the popular media there is still a perception of the tech industry as a place where any geeky college dropout can build a billion-dollar company with just a course on JavaScript, a smattering of linear algebra, and a vague but firm conviction that he is doing the right thing. In Silicon Valley itself, people are well aware that this is hardly any longer the case.

at the moment when it came to be understood. A good candidate for this moment is the publication of _Zero to One_ by Peter Thiel in late 2014. The book appeared at a time of mild economic recovery and tepid liberal politics, with the coming populist uprising still faint on the horizon. On Stanford's campus there still predominated a culture of optimism; founding a company like Snapchat was a goal both admirable and within reach.

The impact that _ZtO_ had in this environment is difficult to understand because most people never really understood what it was. The book billed itself as a thoughtful and erudite self-help book for entrepreneurs, a manual for "how to build the future." And critics engaged with it at face value, reviewing it as if it were a hopeful paean to industry and entrepreneurial vision. But any perceptive reader who was seriously engaged in a creative endeavor — and of course this rules out most of the critics on both counts — could tell that this paean was not a self-help book at all. Or at least not of the sort one might think.

A self-help book is a proof by construction. The author is tasked with demonstrating that a certain form of success is possible for the reader, and the method of demonstration is by providing a procedure by which success may be constructed. By various arguments, the author attempts to convince the reader that following some algorithm _A_ will leads to some desired outcome. And of course, because the world is messy and full of contingency, these arguments are usually far from watertight.

The logical structure of _ZtO_ is not like this at all. Thiel does not argue that you can be a successful entrepreneur if you apply algorithm _A_. He argues instead that if an entrepreneur is successful, he must have property _P_ — that if a company is successful, it must be of form _F_. His arguments can be cleaner because he is not trying to prove the existence or possibility of success, only to ascertain its properties.

Hence the book's doubled reception. To the book critic, for whom startups only exist in the world as Other, the book enumerates various noble qualities of America's entrepreneurs — their intellectual courage, their seemingly contradictory spirit, their powerful camaraderie. To the founder, for whom a single startup is Self, the book says only this: that _you may or may not be able to start a successful company. But if you could, it would lie in this difficult, perhaps infeasibly small area of possibility space_. It is easy for someone removed from the action to find _Zero to One_ "inspirational." But for someone actually involved in founding a company,
_ZtO_ resembles a proof by contradiction far more than a proof by construction.




# I. Computation

Man is a deterministic function. 

This fact took him a while to realize. There was a point where it was commonly believed that there was something acausal about the human will. Centuries of abrasion against the Newtonian grindstone have worn this "something" down from all-pervading _anima_ to quantum foam in the brain. The universe, for all intents and purposes, is a mechanical one; we are part of it, and hence we are mechanical.

This does not sit well with us. We would like to believe that we have something called free will.
