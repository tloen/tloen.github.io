_tl;dr:_

- Expecting people to act against their own enlightened self-interest is unrealistic at best and immoral at worst.
- In fact, responsibility for aligning incentives falls on the chief executive, and is in fact their main responsibility. With enough capital, most opportunities can be exploited simply by persistently and impartially enforcing good standards in hiring, strategy, and execution.
- The real use of incentives is to prevent distraction. A well-functioning incentive system eliminates politics, grandstanding, and deceit.

Consider the following three manifestations of principal-agent problems in organizations.

- If managers are rewarded for successful projects, but not held accountable for the outlay,
  they will aim to maximize their outlay to gain recognition and expand control of organizational resources.
- If employees are not rewarded for outperformance or punished for underperformance,
  outperformance is _de facto_ punished by wasted effort and the disgust of injustice.
  Thus formerly outperforming employees will become underperforming or quit.
- If executives are not accountable for the outcome of the business, they may fail to hold the organization together and fly off to Miami to wind down the company's funds by the beach.

How may we eliminate such problems effectively?
The laziest and least effective approach
would be to hector people for responding rationally to incentives.

One frequently encounters people who believe
that man is faced always with the opportunity to profit at the expense of the whole,
and that society functions precisely because he chooses not do this for higher reason.
In this model, it is the public virtue of many individuals that holds society together,
sociopaths can get ahead simply by compromising their moral principles,
and cultural changes corrosive to this virtue are highly dangerous.
Whenever outcomes fall short of expectations, it is ascribe to a deficit of virtue
in the people involved.

It is easy to lodge objections to this worldview.
Empirically, it seems that unlike opportunities for sin,
opportunities for significant private profit at public expense are difficult to come by;
more often, they are hallucinated by people trying to explain their relative lack of success.
Moreover, it seems like we already live in a culture without shared moral values,
where most people more concerned with their own interests than in
a quest to realize their ideals of selflessness.
Most importantly,
I would argue that widespread striving for public virtue over private interest
an essentially poisonous ideal that cripples man's ability to exercise his own judgment.

Consider the following gloss of _Laozi_ 18 above:

- 大道廢，有仁義 — public-spiritedness becomes a recognized virtue only when
  the interest of an organization becomes misaligned with
  the interest of its employees, to the extent that the organization can only
  function on its employees' sense of duty;
- 智慧出，有大偽 — much of what passes for "bureaucratic expertise"
  or "leadership ability" is merely the use of charisma and narrativecrafting
  to lure employees into acting against their own interests,
  and in the interest of the organization;
- 六親不和，有孝慈 — an organization would only profess to value "family"
  or "community" if the underlying relationship is by nature disharmonious,
  _i.e._ it is embroiled in internecine, zero-sum conflicts;
- 國家昏亂，有忠臣 — an organization would only profess to value "loyal" or
  "mission-driven" employees if it has decayed to the point that people stay around only out of loyalty.

What the _Laozi_ argues is that public virtue and exploitation are coextensive.
This is especially clear in American capitalism,
where an organization's legitimacy derives from its ability
to maximize shareholder value, and any other "mission" is a convenient fiction.
The modern exemplar of public-spiritedness is the long-suffering infrastructure engineer
who is beset by endless obligations and commitments
to teams and services that "depend on him,"
who is kept on his treadmill of misery by a carefully timed trickle of
badges and raises,
and who can only cry himself to sleep when reflects on the endless bureaucratic
nightmare his life has become.

What virtue is loyalty in conditions like these?
Man is not ruled entirely by self-interest —
but this may not be a good thing.

Public virtue arises in the gap between the interest of the parts
and the interest of the whole; it is a ramshackle mechanism,
cobbled together from prehistoric reciprocity norms,
that convinces individuals to identify their interests
with those of the organization around them.
That public virtue is an ostensibly universal ideal
symptomatizes a deep, longstanding, and all-pervading plague of
dysfunctional organizations that are out of alignment with
the people they contain — the "abandonment of the Way."

Consider the implications for tech startups.
When a founder sets out to build an startup on public virtue rather than private interest,
and seeks to hire "loyal" employees over "strategic" ones,
he commits to a dangerous course —
to the mediocrity of hires who can't act effectively in their own interest,
to the evil of deceiving people to act against their self-interest as a matter of policy,
and to the fragility inherent in a system that depends on continual exploitation.
In a spiral of mutually reinforcing effects, dysfunction proliferates endlessly:
mediocrity enables greater evil,
evil deepens fragility,
and fragility perpetuates mediocrity to protect itself.
It is no coincidence that the capitalists who most value public virtue
create the most tyrannical environments.

Reader, man is better governed by interest than by moralism.
Incentives must be structured correctly from the beginning.
Organizational dysfunction is not an individual vice, but a systemic one;
when the incentive structure of an organization is compromised,
virtue can only delay its collapse.
And to hang an organization's fate _ex ante_ on irruptions of public-spiritedness
is not just imprudent but actively harmful.

How, then, might we build an organization
in which public virtue and private interest are one?

We begin by recognizing the importance of the chief executive,
who has discretionary control over the resources of the organization.
This gives him maximal control over the system of incentives;
he is limited only by the investors, the law,
and the size of the organization's bank account.
Because the incentive system is most easily changed by the chief executive,
the chief executive should be responsible for maintaining these incentives;
because most other functions can be delegated to specialists,
maintaining the incentive system should be the chief executive's main responsibility.

Maintaining incentives involves maintaining high standards for projects that are undertaken,
and rigidly holding people accountable to those standards
with the "two handles" of reward and punishment.
In a mature bureaucracy, this means keeping KPI targets inflexible,
collecting detailed statistics on progress toward those targets,
and assessing outcomes impartially.
In an early-stage company, this means fostering a culture of high standards by
readily evaluating and acknowledging the difference between good and bad work.

Armed with sufficient capital and resolve[^ceo],
there is very little the executive needs to do besides enforcing standards.
One can exploit any opportunity, no matter how undefined,
simply by selecting a team of capable people
and relentlessly, impartially aligning their incentives with those of the business.
Being a skilled chief executive is therefore entirely a matter of discernment
and grim courage —
having the perceptive power required to understand the flow of incentives through the organization,
the general knowledge required to evaluate the open-ended work produced
in the early stages of the company,
and the determination to apply incentives even when personally painful —
_e.g._ firing one's own brother.

In particular, the CEO need not be creative or clever —
the beast of capital has a creativity of its own,
issuing forth an endless froth of possibilities and proposals,
and the CEO's only job is to tame this beast with the consistent application of
standards, rewards, and punishments.

There are many good examples of this in business textbooks,
so here's a bad one.
I recently heard an account of a deal-making business run by a
famous founder-investor with a reputation for disagreeableness and operational excellence.
The employees of this company are on call apparently at all hours;
direct, urgent missives come down from the CEO on Sunday evenings,
demanding thorough responses.

This working situation, though unpleasant,
also represents the situation of the business.
Just as failing to respond quickly and properly
to the external party could cost the business millions in revenue,
failing to respond quickly and properly
to the CEO's message would be painful for the email's recipient,
who will have to deal with a screaming superior the next morning.
Thus, by being disagreeable, the CEO
translates downside for the business into downside for the employees,
which is counterbalanced by a healthy pay bump to the upside
that the business has the capital to afford.
(A large slice of high finance also seems to work like this.)

Once incentives are aligned like this, decisions can be made with
a much greater degree of transparency.
When the interests of the business are aligned with the interests of the employees —
that is, when the relationship between capital and labor is not
always-already exploitative —
there is little sense in withholding information from the employees.
After all, an employee who properly understands that the Sunday-afternoon email
comes not from the CEO but from the business itself, and by extension
from the stock options vesting comfortably in their name,
will not resent the chief executive for acting as the messenger
of their own financial interest.

When the returns on organizational politics are low,
employees will spend less time forming schemes or defending against them.
When it is impossible to get ahead by overpromising and underdelivering,
employees will promise only what they know they can deliver.
When doing one's work well carries a credible promise of fair reward,
employees will no longer be concerned with reconnoitering their colleagues
in fear of being unjustly passed over in their favor.

In a well-functioning organization, one could say:

> God's in his heaven— \
> All's right in the world;

the world is just,
there is only one way to get ahead,
and that way has a credible promise of reward.
Rather than praying for a world of universal public virtue,
or deceiving his subordinates into a misguided loyalty,
the leader of an organization should act to create
an organization where moral and intellectual virtues form a unity —
where the incentives to do good work are arranged so perfectly
that employees, finding it pointless to think about them,
can finally focus on doing their job well.

[^ceo]: I have some thoughts on CEO accountability and incentive structure, but I don't think I can fit them in here. Maybe some other time?
