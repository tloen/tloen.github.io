### I. Man in the world, racked with doubt

> But there is something even more distressing than any of this: to be caught between the two pitfalls of _benefit_ and _harm_ as they grind away at each other, and to have no third way out to avoid them, scuttling unsteadily between them and accomplishing nothing, the heart and mind straining as if stretched between sky and earth, pressed and glum and engulfed and imperiled. For this is what produces the most extensive conflagrations, the kind that in most people burn away the harmony in them, like the light of the moon overpowered by the glare of a flame. It is due to this that they finally collapse entirely, the Course in them entirely depleted. (trans. Ziporyn) [^legge]

Now comforted, now pitied, they are plunged in difficulties. The ideas of _profit_ and of _injury_ rub against each other, and produce in them a very great fire. The harmony of the mind is consumed in the mass of men. Their moonlike intelligence cannot overcome the fire. They thereupon fall away more and more, and the Course is lost. (trans. Legge)

It is a basic result of experimental microeconomics that man is by nature risk-averse.
The source of this nature, and whether it is rational or irrational, is a matter of ongoing debate.

If it is rational, it is usually a logical consequence of a loss-averse (_i.e._, concave) utility function, which in turn could be explained as a response to the
diminishing marginal utility of money.
Assuming rationality and consistency allows economists to construct a hierarchy of interlocking
utility functions, microfounding the consumption-based model of asset pricing and other elegant, comprehensive, and ultimately unworkable models of the economy.

If it is irrational, it is usually a maladaptive cognitive bias developed
to protect us from the dangers of wild animals in the African savannah,
inconsistent with modernity's defraying of risk and the approximate linearity of large systems.
Assuming irrationality and inconsistency allows us to cast risk aversion and loss aversion as moral failures, and to demand risk-taking and ambition as bourgeois virtues; the world is more malleable than you think — _audentis Fortuna iuvat!_
Spurning fear and restraint, these risk-lovers throw themselves at the world,
denying their fear and flattening their utility functions,
only to find themselves disappointed burnouts by their late twenties.

Caught between two unsavory options,
we aim to progress by demolishing the frame of the question entirely.
After all, can we really reason about our level of wealth as the measure of all decisions,
or as the source of all outcomes?
If not, can we reason about anything else with the quantitative precision
with which we may reason about wealth?
And if not — if utility, outcome, world, and action alike admit no easy measure —
what point is there in speaking of convex utility at all,
except to paint the heart's topology with the false certainty of a sigma-algebra?
_Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will_ —
know the language of microeconomics,
but remember that its meaning is always indexical and, frequently,
indexical of nothing.

Abandoning theory, let us return to experience.
The heart experiences benefit and harm as two emotions: fear and desire.
We know these emotions are separate and orthogonal,
rather than being opposed sides of the same coin,
because they act against one another frequently and violently,
as the _Zhuangzi_ notes, in a manner that locks the individual in
a state of unease and strife in which nothing is accomplished.
One may say, indeed, that

> It is obvious that the same thing will never do or suffer opposites in the same respect in relation to the same thing and at the same time. So that if ever we find these contradictions in the functions of the mind we shall know that it was not the same thing functioning but a plurality. (trans. Shorey)

[^plato]:
    > δῆλον ὅτι ταὐτὸν τἀναντία ποιεῖν ἢ πάσχειν κατὰ ταὐτόν γε καὶ πρὸς ταὐτὸν οὐκ ἐθελήσει ἅμα, ὥστε ἄν που εὑρίσκωμεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ταῦτα γιγνόμενα, εἰσόμεθα ὅτι οὐ ταὐτὸν ἦν ἀλλὰ πλείω.

The soul contains fear and desire,
two grindstones between which we weary ourselves uselessly into the grave.
When we ask ourselves how we should think about gain, loss, and risk,
we may then ask instead:
_what posture ought we to adopt with respect to fear and desire, such that we most effectively advance our situation at a minimum of emotional suffering?_ Ideally:

- We may minimize our emotional turmoil by ending the conflict between fear and desire;
- We may minimize the distortions of fear without compromising our ability to avoid harm;
- We may minimize our liability to disappointment without diminishing our ability to achieve our goals.

I believe that the main purpose of fear is to direct our attention towards the management of risk; that the main purpose of desire is to direct our attention towards the pursuit of our goals; that desire does not imply lack, and, in fact, that desire is often confused with an element of fear that attaches itself to it; that, once the attention is focused, either on risk management or the pursuit of goals, lack — but not desire itself — distorts our ability to reason effectively about the world; and that we are most effective when we rid ourselves of fear, making our desire synonymous with a disposition to action.

Man interprets his actions as the consequence of goal-oriented activity,
applied towards one of several commonly accepted ends —
_e.g._, physical pleasure, the cessation of pain, and the respect of one's peers.
Because the self makes itself known to itself through action, which transforms the world,
philosophers frequently assume that the fundamental nature of the self is to negate;
that
"Substance is, as Subject, pure, _simple negativity_" (Hegel).
Hence the fundamentally reactive nature of consciousness;
when our actions come to our own attention,
we can attach them to the rational _I_ or _ego_ of our internal monologue
only by interpreting them as aiming towards the negation of a specific circumstance,
_i.e._ the resolution of some lack,
whose existence we had only known from our actions themselves.
Finally, we suffocatingly identify negative, goal-oriented behavior with
"reason" and sanity, imposing on ourselves social norms demanding our behavior to be
self-consistently negative at higher and higher levels.

But the constrained scope of goal-oriented behavior seems at odds with how
life is actually lived in post-industrial economies —
that is, absorbed constantly in one glass-bead game or another,
without any coherent narrative of progress or purpose.
The mind loses track of its objective relation to the world while
watching Netflix, playing online chess, or solving mathematical problems;
the reason is engaged, but in ways conventionally considered "irrational";
the ego dissolves, and the self actuates something _active_ rather than _reactive_ within it,
engendering desire that is not lack.
A principal characteristic of postmodern life is that the ego is dissolved in the virtual,
and the spirit is free to play among the ten thousand things.
Put aside Kaczynski's paranoia,
and we may come to see it as a positive thing
that the self is a vessel that brims with active desires and inclinations,
rather than an animal ego harried by needs and fears.

Achievement is the result of action, which is the result of desire.
When we accept that desire does not entail lack,
we may begin to consider that achievement does not entail suffering.
And although we cling to achievement,
if only as a narrative device for the sake of motivating ourselves to write this essay,
we can make out the dim outlines of a worldview
where having a "chip on one's shoulder"
or a "point to prove" is only a second-rate way to achieve one's goals.

The conventional model of motivation dictates that someone seeking sustained performance
should "stay hungry";
that is, for sustained performance,
one should be driven by a perpetual feeling of insufficiency
that forces them to stay lean and unsafisfied.
Hunger connotes a fierce, ascetic discipline,
as well as a spry energy and thinness of build.
But reader, the man who admonished you to _stay hungry, stay foolish_
died at 56 after eating nothing but fruit juice for years.
Yes, the stress of hunger releases cortisol and adrenaline,
both of which can aid performance in the short term;
however, an extended stress response causes the body to wear down
and the mind to become cynical and depressed.
And at the end of what Selye called the "general adaptation syndrome"
comes death, that final inability to cope.

In the time before death, the life of a hungry ghost isn't much better.
Tell the body for too long that it is always in danger of starvation,
and it will begin to shut down the higher functions of human existence
— initiative, impulse control, lateral thinking —
leaving one fearful, impatient, and dull.
These are poor qualities, particularly for getting out of a bad situation;
the fearful are bad at trying new things,
the impatient feel compelled to act even when there are no good options,
and the dull cannot see good options right in front of their eyes.

Sustained and focused performance at a high level
can only be undertaken from a position of abundance,
from which the soul feels at ease to take risks,
explore new ideas, and mobilize all of its resources to do so.
The soul's desires in this state do not arise from a perpetual hunger,
but rather from the sense of playfulness, curiosity, and aspiration to virtue
that attends any objective measure of excellence.
It is only when the soul is at ease that the
"reactive" force of burdensome consciousness within it is overcome by the
"active," playful force of the embodied and intrinsically motivated self.
When our desires are fully without lack,
success in life becomes nothing different from an endless game of chess,
or a particularly difficult math problem — the beautiful exhaust
of an organism at the height of its capacities, pursuing its will to power.
