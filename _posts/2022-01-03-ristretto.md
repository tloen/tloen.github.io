It's not so hard to follow detailed plans — \
So _Friktion ist der einzige Begriff_ \
Explaining how Ulysses might oblige \
To hold his breath and suffer as he did.

Heard NOAA from the Lord: "Avoid'st thou roads, \
The sky, and open air, for risk to life; \
Quick follows the deluge on Zephyr's heel, \
My judgment of a city built on sand." \
Could I, ere fifty, hold to heaven's will? \
Not easy: First _serré_, then _très serré_ \
I turn the crank. With half a dozen shots \
An arrant mind can leave its watery bounds. \
There is a certain smoothness in the way \
The myriad things conspire to drown themselves, \
To bend intention inward, and to grind \
The spirit's inborn excesses to dust. \
For all my life's gone smooth — my hilltop home's \
Blank plaster walls and hardwood floors, my brain's \
Gray-matter-gyri, and my ashen heart \
All bear the mark of Heaven's pottery-wheel.

Now fifty miles nautical divide \
His kingdom from the man of many ways. \
Besides his vessel's shattered wreck he waits \
For some auspicious movement in the stars \
To tide him on his journey. Ought he wait, \
Or has he withered long before his years?
