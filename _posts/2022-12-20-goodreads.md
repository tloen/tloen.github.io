A smattering of published prose \
Contains nothing, announces nothing \
Except the simple fact of you. \
I spy your cloudy breath outside, \
Your fingers tracing outlines \
On my frosted-over windowpanes. \
_Coquette, mademoiselle,_ \
What use is there acknowledging \
Myself, my existence, or yours? \
My door's unlocked, the evening's still, \
And I warm myself by the fireplace.
