> In economic life action must be taken without working out all the details of what is to be done. Here the success of everything depends upon intuition, the capacity of seeing things in a way which afterwards proves to be true, even though it cannot be established at the moment, and of grasping the essential fact, discarding the unessential, even though one can give no account of the principles by which this is done.

A friend took me out for dim sum recently and asked about my strategic outlook on the AI industry.
To my good fortune, I had taken another friend out for tapas the night before and grilled him on the same subject,
so I had a ready quiverful of _bons mots_ and trenchant observations to impart.

Generative modeling
has captured knowledge workers' attention in ever-larger waves over the past seven years,
culminating in the broad public sensation of last December's release of ChatGPT.
What was just recently the domain of cowboy hobbyists and grad students is now in its go-to-market phase,
and once again every technologist is asking: _should I trade, or should I fade?_

Though I apparently spend the bulk of my time ferrying information between trendy restaurants,
I do have one or two thoughts of my own
that may be of interest to a general audience.
Pray consult the following.

#### I. Global capitalism

It is somewhat remarkable that
with public tech stocks in a shambles
and the VC industry's reputation in the gutter,
Silicon Valley has passed from one
pulse-quickening mania to another
without missing a beat.
But comparing these phenomena purely on the basis of hype cycles
understates the deep macrofinancial differences between the world of today
and the world of 2020.
I'm not a macro guy, but I'll try to summarize the situation here.

The story starts with Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972,
which kicked off a process of globalization that
would ease inflationary pressures on the dollar
as the productivity-driven postwar productivity boom drew to an end.
As long as we had easy access to cheap oil,
accelerating globalization meant that
the USD's purchasing power would be preserved
at relatively low interest rates in the succeeding decades.
And by selling Treasuries to the PBOC, the US government was able to spend all the dollars China didn't.

The path of globalization continues for several decades. The Berlin Wall falls, China and the Eastern Bloc liberalize, and large new markets are opened up. To accomodate these new markets, the international financial system develops rapidly under relaxed regulations and eventually precipitates the crisis of '07 in a process I won't describe here.

The important takeaway here is that the environment that we currently live in as technologists is deeply conditioned by this crisis.
The financial meltdown caused a wide-scale destruction of wealth in the economy.
As traumatized households became averse to spending and credit,
the savings rate rose and dollar velocity contracted.
To maintain full employment, the Fed cut rates and began a program of quantitative easing.
Correspondingly, M2 money supply continued to grow at previous rates,
while GDP did not
(note that velocity is the size of the gap
between GDP and M2 on a log-scale y-axis):

Bonds and MBSs were dumped on the Fed in exchange for cash, which was recycled back into equities,
allowing corporations to finance projects that put money into the pockets of households.
Even so, the recession had hardly made a dent in FAANG's growth in the first place,
and from 2009 through 2019 their share prices both grew at ~20% a year.

In short, here was the situation at the start of 2009:

- American households were shellshocked and entering recession.
- The FAANG companies, riding a technological wave of Internet and mobile phone adoption, were surging despite this.
- Speculators had had eight years to recover from the dot-com crash, and were salivating at the prospect of another FAANG-style success.
- The Fed was eager to stimulate spending by dumping the shellshocked households' unused purchasing power into speculative investments.

The result, of course, was textbook.

This set of tailwinds gradually eased over the period from 2009-2019.
_The Social Network_ came out in 2010;
Snapchat appeared in 2011,
the same year as Occupy Wall Street;
Facebook acquired Instagram and IPOed in 2012,
the same year Peter Thiel taught the classes that would become
_Zero to One_;
Bitcoin popped in 2013;
the billionth iPhone was sold in 2016,
the same year Trump won and the Fed started hiking again;
Snap IPOed in 2017,
and Bitcoin popped again;
Uber IPOed in 2019,
the same year GPT-2 was announced
and the Fed pivoted from its hikes.
By this time, the economy had recovered,
the yield curve had started to invert,
and the U.S. was entering a trade war with China.
Commentators were abuzz about Big Tech's "overreach"
and "threat to our democracy," while
about half of Stanford's graduating class
was studying computer science.
(We didn't start the fire.)

Throughout this entire process, the VC industry secured massive, long-term commitments from LPs, which they would continue to draw on well past the end of QE3.
Global finance was utterly in love with tech.
Even as cracks began to appear at the seams,
VCs went on deploying capital in larger and larger
amounts.

We all know what happened next.
COVID-19 caused lockdowns everywhere.
As commerce stalled, shortages appeared, most notably in the semiconductor industry,
and people became conscious and resentful of a system that put them at the mercy of a fragile network of global supply chains.
Enterprising public intellectuals called for _sovereignty_ and _independence_ and _state capacity_;
enterprising politicians called for sanctions on China and trillion-dollar fines;
enterprising CEOs called for reshoring subsidies.
Faced with a series of zero-sum situations,
global relations deteriorated rapidly,
particularly between the US and China.

Meanwhile, the Fed, drawing on its experience in '07,
improvised a series of interventions in the financial system to prevent another liquidity collapse.
It more than doubled its balance sheet performing
another quantitative easing operation,
flooding the financial markets with an entire federal budget's worth of liquidity.

Buoyed by a combination of collapsing rates
and mechanical rebalancing,
money flowed out of bonds and into
practically every other asset that promised
any sort of future returns.
The financial industry quickly devolved into an
orgy of bidding on risk assets.
And when public equities had been saturated to the point
where the DCF could barely accomodate even the most outlandish narratives,
it turned to assets that defied spreadsheets entirely.

For a moment, it was startups.
Venture capitalists exhaustively searched
every topical business model category
with the help of a steady stream of
wide-eyed Ivy League dropouts.
Y Combinator, freed from its physical facilities,
scaled to hundreds of companies.
Software engineers quit their jobs in droves to build
doomed remote collaboration solutions.

But the main event was crypto. Crypto is a worthless asset backed by no government.
Its purchasing power is based on the supposed existence
of a group of maladjusted libertarians that decided
to make a political point by ascribing value to it.
Its price increase is sustained by a combination of imprudent speculators,
cynical opportunists,
and financiers taking risks with their careers.

Thus, unlike a tech stock,
crypto's value bears no obvious relation to GDP to a first approximation,
and bears a negative relation to a second.
That is to say, the price of an asset like Bitcoin
measures society's
demand for exceptional excess returns
in the absence of cash flows,
and the size of the DeFi and Web3 industries
measures the size and duration
of the distortions that this demand
has caused in the capital markets.
These industries thrive precisely to the extent
that the demand for returns exceeds the limits
of what the real economy can provide.
And this demand was _massive_.
In fact, it turns out to look a lot like M2 money supply.

Bitcoin was always the risk asset of last resort. But the last in is the first out.
In early 2022, conflict between Russia and Ukraine
caused a global resource shock,
intensifying already-existing inflationary pressures.
In response, the Fed slowed and then began reversing QE4.
Because reflexive assets like Bitcoin are heavily momentum-driven
in a freakish, Weierstrassian way,
the value of Bitcoin vanished much faster than
the liquidity,
and it tumbled into the garbage —
along with Terra, and Three Arrows, and FTX, and everything.

Alright — why did I just give an overview of everything that has happened in the past fifty years _besides AI_ in the first section of my AI article?
I do this to emphasize how completely different the situation is from the world the reader of this blog may be used to, each of whose components unwound significantly in the years 2020-2022.
In particular:

- The deflationary tailwind of globalization has vanished
  as geopolitical tensions continue to rise.
  As onshoring continues, upward pressure will be applied to the price level, raising the Fed's equilibrium target rate and hurting the valuation of financial assets.
- The public markets have largely soured on tech IPOs, and the prevailing wisdom is that private market valuations are inflated.
  Several big-name 2020 IPOs are down as much as 98% from their peak.
- A number of VC firms, already performing poorly, will struggle to raise new capital as rates rise and bonds continue to soak liquidity back up, causing a further "shortage" of capital.
- The markets discount a recession in the coming year; the bulk of artificial intelligence's proposed value proposition is correlated positively with economic activity, rather than negatively as crypto was.

The current AI hype cycle seems superficially similar to the crypto hype cycle of 2021,
but the material conditions are very different, and the material determines the ideal.
This time, unlike in 1997 or 2009 or 2021,
a broad-based financial hangover and economic hangover are coming fast on one another's heels.
There is much less room for the Fed to use financial assets as a conduit to save the economy again.

Without the easy money provided by recession trauma,
and with the _reductio ad absurdum_
of the years 2020-2022,
a number of bad habits from even the pre-crypto era need to be unlearned:
growth over profits,
speed over discipline,
courage over experience,
idea over execution,
_default investable_ over _default alive_.
To be successful in this liminal period will require
perceptiveness, quick thinking,
and most of all a firm and steady operational discipline —
at least, until the bubble begins in earnest.

> As the famed investor Benjamin Graham said, "In the short term, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term, it’s a weighing machine." Clearly there was a lot of voting going on in the boom year of ’99—and much less weighing. We’re a company that wants to be weighed, and over time, we will be—over the long term, all companies are. In the meantime, we have our heads down working to build a heavier and heavier company.

- _don't rush to start something_
- _don't rush to spend money_
- _don't invest in AI companies run by college dropouts_
- _OpenAI is the new Palantir/Stripe; only work there for social capital_
- _think carefully about positioning re: the "bitter lesson"_
- _ML is significantly more exhausting than SWE_
- _optionality is maximized at the systems layer_
- _agency is maximized at the application layer_
- _probably a bad time to start something unless you can raise a lot and sit on it_
- _"growth at all costs" is over, but not totally over_
- _smart people should learn CUDA, brave people should learn about management and corporate finance_
