_Continued from [part 2](/2020/04/30/undetermined.html)._

Having now constructed the phenomenon of the undetermined class, we see immediately that this phenomenon is already overdetermined. The territory we have traversed has already been mapped in several different ways by a number of relatively famous thinkers, some of whose ideas I have referenced by name. Why do we need another curmudgeon essay about elite risk aversion, about "preserving optionality," about complacency, indefinite optimism, low conviction, liquid modernity? Why take such an odd route to conceptualize a conclusion that has already been reached?

To understand what I have been trying to accomplish here, let us summarize our progress up to this point. We began, somewhat arbitrarily, from the aspiring startup founder. From the necessary struggles of this founder _qua_ founder we unearthed the existing reality of the undetermined class; moving from abstract to concrete, we outlined the basic features of this class as it currently exists, as well as a materialist account of its emergence. We can now use our understanding the founder's historical situation to answer previously unanswerable questions about him. Most pertinently, I believe that the concept of undetermination allows us to make practical claims relating to how the founder should go about surmounting these obstacles, and that it enables these claims to a far greater extent than the other concepts mentioned.

These claims require a final, more difficult theoretical leap. So let us press on.

The undetermined class is composed of undetermined subjects. Let us call _determination_ the property whose lack is the essence of the undetermined subject. We would like a theory of determination; we would like to understand what sort of thing determination is, so that we may acquire some of it for ourselves. To this end we should begin by asking: well, what sort of thing is its lack?

The undetermined subject is undetermined because it is not fixed. For the emergence of the undetermined subject it was necessary that many of the social and cultural factors that previously held it in place have been removed, at least in part. But freedom, although necessary, is not a sufficient condition. The undetermined subject only appears when it is unwilling to exercise the freedom presented to it. We can rearrange these terms: the undetermined subject is free, but it has no free will.

What does this actually mean?

By _freedom_ I mean the space of possibilities open to being actualized. By _will_ I mean the process by which this space of possibilities is actualized. Freedom is being; will is becoming. Freedom is essence; will is existence. The undetermined subject has an enormous amount of freedom. This freedom is purely abstract. As the scope of freedom expands in history, there comes a point where the limiting factor to free will is not freedom, but will[^libs]. And indeed, the undetermined subject is characterized precisely by an abundance of freedom and a corresponding paucity of will.

[^libs]: It is somewhat telling that liberalism as a political ideology has chosen this moment in history to run out of steam.

What we want is a theory of determination. Thus we are operating under the assumption that there is a more fundamental quality, determination, whose absence is the cause of undetermination. And undetermination arises when freedom exceeds its will. Thus the subject becomes more determined when its will increases or its freedom decreases.

Note that these correspond precisely to two dictionary definitions of determination:

> 1. Firmness of purpose; resoluteness.  
>    (_free determination; determination as a function of will, with freedom held constant_)
> 2. The controlling or deciding of something's nature or outcome.  
>    (_unfree determination; determination as a function of freedom, with will held constant_)

And if undetermination is the gap between freedom and the will, determination is this same gap considered in the opposite direction. It is the movement from freedom to will. It is the bridge between contemplation and action. We see now that there are two types of undetermination: a _free_ determination, where will expands to fill its given freedom, and an _unfree_ determination, in which freedom contracts to fit around a given will.

If we seek determination and we are unwilling or unable to give up our freedom, the determination to which we aspire must be free determination. To move toward free determination from a position of preexisting freedom is to move toward free will. So what sort of thing is free will?

A free will is commonly understood as one whose decisions are not determined primarily by external factors. But this is a rather coarse way to put it. Since Newton we have known that no such thing really exists. Each will is a flow in the stream of causality; there is no unmoved mover.

We will sidestep the endless tangle of language games surrounding the question of whether free will is compatible with determinism. By means of complexity theory I argued in [an earlier essay](/2020/03/31/entropy.html) that will, randomness, and computation are three components of information entropy.

Determination, being the resolution of uncertainty, is a form of information. So we may use the tools of information theory to reason about determination, and to make practical claims about how it may be acquired.
