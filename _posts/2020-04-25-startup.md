_The following begins a multi-part essay about how the mind moves from abstract contemplation to concrete action and the obstacles that it encounters. I would recommend that you begin with [my post on theorizing human decision](/2020/03/31/entropy.html) if you haven't read it yet._

Everyone in Silicon Valley knows that it is hardly any longer true that a geeky Stanford student can build a large and successful company with just JavaScript, linear algebra, and a vague but firm conviction that he is doing the right thing. But it is worth probing into why this is the case.

By Silicon Valley standards, a successful company must capture, and optionally create, a large amount of value. To capture value, it must insert itself into a process that is valuable to someone. The value it captures is proportional to how valuable this process is to that someone. Hence, for the company to capture a large amount of value, it must embed itself into a process that is either very valuable to a few people or at least a little valuable to everyone. [Consider breaking up?]

A company embeds itself in a process ("acquires market share") by seeking rent[^rent]. Rent can be sought in a number of ways; historically, the most acceptable has been _Schumpeterian rent_, or the arbitrage between local productivity improvements and a market in which these improvements have not become widespread. Though few would admit to it openly, most successful tech companies also seek another form of rent: _network rent_, which is the added value that a company can provide due to its preexisting market share. Network effects create natural monopolies; a perceptive observer may note that all honest network rents want (and tend) to become monopoly rents.

[^rent]: To those who object that companies who create new markets are hardly seeking rent on them, I would respond that they have an overly narrow definition of what a market is. Social networks like Facebook tap into a human need for connection that defines a market in itself. The fact that they have increased consumption in this market (beyond, say, phone lines or the postal service) speaks only to the fact that they have obtained more rents than was previously historically possible. What must be kept in mind is that the seeking of rents is not necessarily a bad thing; rent enables the promise of superprofits that is necessary to compensate the risk that goes into innovation. Whether a specific rent is justified in this sense is a separate question entirely.

The function of the tech entrepreneur _qua_ tech entrepreneur is to choose a problem and a solution to that problem. The success of a startup is determined by the value of its problem and the rents that can be sought with its solution. This is an underdetermined system. The rents that can be sought on the solution are either Schumpeterian rents, which are determined by the entrepreneur's specific technical and managerial capacities, or network rents, which are determined by the entrepreneur's relative ability to raise and sell.

Let us say that, for some reason or another, someone starts out with the abstract goal of starting a billion-dollar tech company — that is, of "making it." Call this person the Aspirant. Regardless of what idea he chooses, he must become a good entrepreneur; that is, he must acquire the qualities required to execute well the function described above:

- General technical skills that can be applied to most problems.
- General management skills that can be applied in most situations.
- The ability to raise and sell — a combination of credentials, connections, and the ability to effectively signal the above.

The Aspirant thus sets himself diligently about the task of acquiring these general, idea-agnostic skills. It is typically a good heuristic to make decisions as late as possible, and it is not yet time where the choice of idea has a meaningful bearing on the next action. In his education, the Aspirant acquires practical skills of how to act and think. He meets and befriends those around him who are worth knowing. He acquires, with a knowing irony, a number of impressive credentials; he cycles through a number of jobs and internships, soaking up experience and understanding.

But sooner or later, the time comes for action. And action is something different from contemplation. To enter the field of action, the Aspirant needs an idea. And based on this idea, he also needs:

- A strong foundation of working knowledge of the idea's vertical.
- Specific technical skills required to actualize this idea.
- A credible story of why he is the right vehicle for the idea.

The Aspirant can acquire all of these. But each requires a significant investment of time and effort — and, more importantly, _they bear a severe opportunity cost_. The capacities specific to one idea may generalize only marginally to others. Time spent on a bad idea is wasted. And the opportunity cost of spending time on a bad idea is as great as the number of alternatives the Aspirant has.

Stanford, my alma mater, is notorious for its startup culture. We are thought of in the popular imagination and in that of our humanities professors as a colony of entrepreneurial philistines, a "VC fund with a school attached." But this "startup culture" does not in fact exist. Yes, Stanford has a serious infestation of techies. Yes, many of these techies want to start companies and strike it rich. They snag internships, publish papers, and network. They acquire everything they need to "do their own thing," when the time comes.

But the time rarely comes. The opportunity cost is why.
