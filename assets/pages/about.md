I am a technologist living in San Francisco.
In previous lives, I was a grad student at Stanford,
an analyst at a hedge fund,
and the founding editor of [_The Gradient_](https://thegradient.pub/).
On this site, I collect fragments about a selection of my interests.

_Caveat lector._
My writing exists primarily to clarify problems for myself,
and only secondarily to serve as points of reference for my friends and colleagues;
therefore, expect ponderous syllogisms,
rough composition,
and a narrow focus on topics of limited interest.
All of this is exhaust; none of it is for you.
