I am a technologist living in San Francisco.
In previous lives, I was a grad student at Stanford,
an analyst at a hedge fund,
and founding editor of [_The Gradient_](https://thegradient.pub/).

This blog exists primarily to clarify problems for myself,
and only secondarily to serve as points of reference for my friends and colleagues;
therefore, expect rough and mathematical prose
about topics of limited interest.

The website itself is written in Jekyll and typeset with [Equity](https://practicaltypography.com/equity.html) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). The theme is a very heavily modified version of [Kikofri](https://kxxvii.github.io/Kikofri/ofri).
