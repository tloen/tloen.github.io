I am a technologist living in San Francisco.
In previous lives, I was a grad student at Stanford,
the founding editor of [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/),
and an analyst at a hedge fund.
On this site, I collect fragments about a selection of my interests, including:

- artificial intelligence
- human physiology
- Chinese ethical and political philosophy

_Caveat lector._
My essays exist primarily to clarify problems for myself,
and only secondarily to serve as points of reference for my friends and colleagues;
therefore, expect ponderous syllogisms,
rough composition,
and a narrow focus on topics of limited interest.
