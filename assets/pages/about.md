I am a technologist living in San Francisco.
On this site, I hope to collect fragments about a selection of my interests:

- artificial intelligence
- human physiology
- personal and organizational effectiveness
- Chinese ethical and political philosophy

Ultimately, my interest is in reality and how we come to relate to it practically; the above are simply my preferred means of pursuing it.
My strongest intellectual influences are Samuel Johnson and Han Feizi.
