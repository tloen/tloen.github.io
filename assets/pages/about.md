I am a technologist living in San Francisco.
In previous lives, I was a grad student at Stanford and an analyst at a hedge fund.
On this site, I hope to collect fragments about a selection of my interests, including:

- artificial intelligence
- human physiology
- personal and organizational effectiveness
- Chinese ethical and political philosophy

You can find me elsewhere:
