I am a technologist living in San Francisco.
In previous lives, I was a grad student at Stanford,
an analyst at a hedge fund,
and the founding editor of [_The Gradient_](https://thegradient.pub/).
On this site, I collect fragments about a selection of my interests.

This blog exists primarily to clarify problems for myself,
and only secondarily to serve as points of reference for my friends and colleagues;
therefore, expect rough and mathematical prose
about topics of limited interest.

You can find me elsewhere:
