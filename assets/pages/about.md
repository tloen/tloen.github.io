My interests include:

- Technological progress
- The nature of knowledge; its acquisition and dissemination
- Philosophies of history and politics
- Scale and the limits of growth
- Machine learning, supervised or otherwise

Most public writing is vain, misguided, or both;
I do not pretend mine is an exception.
I try my best to be an infrequent writer, but I often fail.

I studied mathematics at Stanford.

I've previously worked at Google, Palantir, and a few startups.

I'm currently working on something good.
